# LITMP-Smart-Mirror
This code is for a smart mirror project submitted to LIT Creations, a project program within the SWE at UT Dallas Ladies In Tech Mentoring Program.

This code runs on an MSP432P401R LaunchPad, and it uses an Ultra Sonic Sensor and LCD to convey messages when the sensor reads within a certain distance.
